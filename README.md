Welcome to the course on **"Calculus"**!

This course is designed to help you develop your calculus skills and gain a deeper understanding of this fascinating subject. Through a series of engaging lectures, and interactive problem-solving sessions, you will learn how to master calculus concepts such as analytic geometry, series, integrals, and differential equations. In order to gain a deeper understanding of calculus, I have incorporated proofs of some mathematical analysis theorems into my teaching materials. I hope that this lecture note I have written can be helpful to you.

The repository includes the following documents:

- PDF document of the lecture notes;
- The LaTeX source file of the lecture notes;
- answer key for the lecture notes.
